# Red and Green Tomato Predictor 🚦

Welcome to the Red and Green Color Predictor project! This TensorFlow-based computer vision model is designed to predict whether an object contains red color. It utilizes computer vision techniques to preprocess the input frames and employs a TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) model for prediction. Additionally, the project features a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) developed using the Kivy framework.

## Features 🎨

- Utilizes TensorFlow for computer vision tasks.
- Predicts whether an image contains red colors or not.
- Simple and intuitive GUI powered by Kivy.

## Getting Started 🚀

To get started with the Red and Green Color Predictor, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Make sure the tflite model is inside the directory

4. Run the Kivy app:

python main.py


## Usage 🖥️

1. Launch the application by running `main.py`.
2. connect a camera to the computer. You can use your `webcam` or `IP cameras` using your phone.
3. Click the "Verify" button to verify only one Frame Photo.
4. Click the "Verify in video" to verify in videos.
5. Enjoy experimenting with different models and objects!
6. If everything goes well, you will get a GUI that looks like
